# macOS Screenshot Uploader

> This currently only supports the nest.rip host.
> More supported hosts comming soon :)

This uploads screenshots using the native macOS Screenshot tool

### Setup

1. Download this tool from releases
2. Setup this tool using your nest.rip api key
3. Set the macos native screenshot location to the "screenshots" folder in your home directory
4. Screenshots will now auotmatically be uploaded to nest.rip

5. (Optional) Use [Shottr](http://shottr.cc) to instantly upload screenshots, without waiting for the macos delay

### Additional information

The tool currently is not automatically started when you boot up macos, so you have to start it manually. This will be fixed in the future.
